## Starship Classification

### Class 0: Pod

Pod class ships are ultra small self powered vessels ranging from the size of a small dog to the size of a bus. Drones,
torpedos, escape pods, exosuits, and workpods.

Exosuits are ultra small space fairing vehicles often referred to as 'the pickup trucks of space', but they actually
grew out of thee ever-more-complex astronaut suits. Now extremely common and affordable, they have relatively low
endurance (suitable for use in and around a home base, but not further) and often come equipped with manipulator arms
for anchoring or transporting cargo, assembling structures, and performing repairs.

* Length: < 10m
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 0

### Class 1: Starfighter

Starfighters are small 1-2 man attack craft designed to be launched from a nearby home base. Short range and designed
for local support. Equivalent of a 20th century F-15. Civilian use is infrequent favoring the slightly larger shuttles
instead.

* Length: 10-20m
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 1-2

### Class 2: Shuttle

Shuttles are ultra-small, nimble, and often unarmed ships about the size of a winnebago. Designed to take on common
transport, ferrying, and cargo tasks.

* Length: 20-30m
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 2-4

### Class 3: Gunship

Gunships are small FTL-capable military craft, about the size of a modern-day jet aircraft, whose crews range in size
from five (for scouts) to to 12 crew plus 65 passengers (for heavy transports). Gunships do not carry much in the way of
supplies, and can have as few as three crewmen and are meant for fast, inexpensive short-range transport from one system
to another, stopping frequently to refuel and resupply. Civilian models called Sparrows are common for intrasystem
commerce and travel.

* Length: 30-100m
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 4-8

### Class 4: Corvette

Corvettes are quick, nimble and small-sized reconnaissance ships that dance around enemy formations and rely on their
on-board Electronic Countermeasures to baffle the enemy's targeting systems. A corvette uses its dedicated sensor suite
and communications array to relay more accurate targeting information to the rest of the fleet. Corvettes are the
smallest Capital Ship available and frequently used for both military and civilian purposes.

* Length: 100-200m
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 4-8

### Class 5: Frigate

Frigates are small-sized light capital patrol craft, larger than Corvettes, yet smaller than destroyers. They patrol the
edges of critical systems, monitoring ships as the drop from FTL travel, watching for any potential threats, or wanted
ne'er-do-wells. Frigates carry enough supplies to make extended journeys possible. Frigate crews range from 30 (for a
long-range reconnaissance frigate) to 200 (for a "pocket" carrier capable of supporting sparrows). Capable of carrying
out solo operations as much as supporting larger fleet actions, Frigates are versatile vessels who see action on almost
any military situation. The civilian equivalents are called merchantmen, and can operate with as few as 20 crewmen for
a bulk cargo transport to 120 for a luxury passenger liner with 150 passengers, hauling goods and people around
neighboring star systems.

* Length: 200m-500m
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 30-200

### Class 6: Destroyer

Destroyers are medium-sized vessels designed to engage the enemy at closer ranges than Cruisers. Instead of having
a large axial gun mounted along the spine of the vessel like a Battleship, Destroyers are built more stout and compact,
and are outfitted with medium-range turrets, and long-range missile bays.

* Length: 500m-800m
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 30-200

### Class 7: Cruiser

Cruisers are large starhips that are hard-hitting frontliners. Frequently described as Light, Heavy, or Battle Cruisers
These descriptors indicate the size, armor, and armament of a Cruiser. Light Cruisers are fast, nimble and used for
reconnaissance, scouting, and exploration. Heavy Cruisers are balanced ships heavily armored but without significant
firepower used for secure transport or escort vessels. Battlecruisers are armed and armored to the teeth and designed
for war.

* Length: 800m-1200m
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 30-200

### Class 8: Battleship

Battleships are as they always have been: heavily armed and armored warships that dominate the main lines of a battle.
They tend to be armed with large, long-range, axial mounted lasers that can put accurate, devastating fire on-target at
incredible ranges. 1000 meter long vessels that are a step above the battlecruiser. Also has small support vessel
hangers for additional fleet actions.

* Length: 1200m-2km
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 30-200

### Class 9: Carrier

Carriers serve as the home base of fleet operations. Larger than a battleship and slow they can carry and support
multiple squadrons of fighters, shuttles, and lancers carring them into combat.

* Length: 1km-5km
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 30-200

### Class 10: Dreadnought

Dreadnoughts are the big boys. Often 2 kilometers long long and having guns that can typically one-shot other ships,
these things are fearsome to behold.

* Length: 5km-10km
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 30-200

### Class 11: Centurian

Centurions are basically moving space stations. Gargantuan in size. Think DeathStar.

* Length: 10km+
* Width:
* Depth:
* Mass:
* Crew: 30-200

## Starship Equipment

### Power Generators

Power Generators are used to provide a constant source of power that fuels the ship. Generators often have semi variable
outputs but excess energy must be captured and stored or it will be released as heat.

#### Solar Generator

Solar generators are cheap, and perfect for low power situations. Solar Panels tend to have a 15% conversion efficiency
and output 150 watts per square meter. The major benefit however is they require no fuel as long as they are in 
sunlight. 

#### Biofuel Generator

Cheap, inexpensive and not very powerful. Biofuel generators are often paired as a backup with Solar panels and 
batteries for intra system vessels or as an emergency power when a more powerful generator fails. 

| Fuel Use     | Power           | 
|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 Liter/hour | 2 kilowatt/hour |

#### Fusion Generator

Fusion Generators are cheap, and relatively powerful. Most smaller ships rely on a fusion generator for their power 
needs. Obtaining fuel for a fusion generator is simple and often free with a Bussard Ramscoop and a visit to your 
local stars inner orbit.

| Fuel Use       | Power             | 
|----------------|-------------------|
| 0.5 Grams/hour | 500 megawatt/hour |

#### Annihilation Generator

The chain reaction occurring within the magnetic envelope in the core of an annihilation generator produces an 
incredible amount of energy from a series of matter-antimatter reactions. The stream of photons emitted by the reaction
is captured and converted into electrical potential. 

| Fuel Use  | Power            | 
|-----------|------------------|
| 1 kg/hour | 25 petawatt/hour |

#### Hawking Generators

A Hawking Generator produces significantly more energy than a fusion generator by converting the emitted hawking 
radiation from the decay of a mini black hole held within magnetic confinement. Should the field ever fail the 
generator would consume the ship and any matter around it before quickly evaporating due to lack of mass. Note that the
explosion that occurs when a black hole evaporates is impressive. 

`A black hole weighing 606,000 metric tons (6.06 × 108 kg) would have a Schwarzschild radius of 0.9 attometers (0.9 × 
10–18 m, or 9 × 10–19 m), a power output of 160 petawatt/hr (160 × 1015 W, or 1.6 × 1017 W), and a 3.5-year lifespan.`

#### Zero Point Energy

A Zero Point Energy Generator or Zippy Generator while expensive is one of the most advanced and capable methods of
power generation known throughout the galaxy. Capable of powering the most massive of spacecraft without fuel.

### Powerbanks

Powerbanks are power storage used to store and release power as necessary. Paired with Solar power and generators to 
capture excess power not actively used, they can provide continual power when generators are off or a ship is in the 
shadow of a planet. Small ships may recharge aat a station with a large power bank and only have a generator for 
emergencies. 

Chemical batteries have been around for millennia and data back to the earliest civilizations of mankind. Often having 
low density and discharge rates, they are cheap but readily available.

### Supercapacitors

Supercapacitors are a form of power storage that is designed for high capacity and rapid discharge. Frequently paired
with shields, warp drives, energy weapons, and hypergate generators. 

### Realspace Drives

#### Ion Thrusters

ION based thrusters allow for a full 6 degrees of freedom movement at low speeds for very little power.

#### Hydrojet

Hydrojet drives are a form of fusion based hydrogen ramjet. They collect hydrogen during flight, compress it using 
magnetic fields and expel the resulting energy as thrust. They are cheap and easy to maintain but are only useful for
short distances and sublight travel.

#### Warp Drives

Warp drives distort space around a ship allowing it to side step physics and travel faster than light. They require a
massive amount of power to operate but allow a ship to move its frame of reference faster than the speed of light. 
The more mass you are warping space around and the faster shift your reference frame the more power the field emitter 
requires to maintain the warp field. They are one of the most frequently used methods of traveling faster than the 
speed of light within a system without outside assistance. Due to the vast space between systems while possible to 
travel between system with a warp drive, it's not common.

### Hyperspace

Hyperspace is an alternate dimension which is used instead of faster than light travel between locations that would
otherwise take longer to travel in normal space. This dimension appears as a deep red chaotic storm and is nigh
impossible to navigate without hypergate beacons, or a natural psionic talent. Hyper gates allow a ship to shift 
between normal space and into hyperspace and require insane amounts of power to operate. Carrying a hypergate generator
is virtually impossible for all but the most massive of ships. 

#### Hyper Drive

Hyperdrives are required for hyperspace travel given that normal physics doesn't apply in hyperspace. Requiring a 
minimal amount of power to operate they are a common sight on most starships. 

### Armor

#### 

#### Ablative Armor

Ablative Armor is best used to absorb the impact of kinetic impacts and fracture instead of passing the force deeper 
into the frame. Ablative armor is frequently layered to absorb incoming kinetic damage.

#### Fibrous Armor

Fibrous armor is a complex weave of plastics, metals, and laminate designed to absorb both energy and kinetic damage in
even amounts. 

#### Plate Armor

Layered Hardened Plate is the standard on star ships.
