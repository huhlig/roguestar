Ancestry is the essence of your bloodline, or 

### The Major Human Races

Humans are the most prevalent creature in the galaxy. As they began to travel the stars they evolved both naturally and
by their own self engineering into new sub-breeds. Still able to intermix but with different characteristics.

#### Embari

The embari are a breed of humans adapted to the weightless environment of early space travel. Having left during the
early stages of first diaspora on the Embari 1 and 2 to escape persecution their colony ships were slow lacking the
acceleration necessary to provide artificial gravity and as a consequence they adapted quickly to fill the roll.
Tall and lanky, the embari still even today dislike any environment with a gravity higher than 50% terra normal. Embari
embraced genetic engineering seeing it as the future of human evolution and were driven from terra due to the
persecution they faced for this view.

Characteristics
* Average Height: 7'
* Average Weight: 150lb
* Preferred Gravity: 3.5 m/s^2
* Preferred Temperature: 15.5c

### Negali

The Negali left Terra on the The Embari Colonial Ships 3 and 4 after the second eugenics war. Unlike the embari they had
not only embraced the power of genetic engineering for themselves but also the integration of cybernetics.

### Fortuna

The fortuna were humans that left during the latter half of the first diaspora on the first colonial accelerator ships.
These early rudimentary vessels would use the ships acceleration as a force of gravity but often at much higher than
10m/s^2. Thus they ended up adapting over time to the high gravity environment of their ships and when selecting new
worlds to colonize favored the thicker atmospheres of high gravity worlds within the habitable zone.

Characteristics
* Average Height: 4'
* Average Weight: 350lb
* Preferred Gravity: 15.4 m/s^2
* Preferred Temperature: 33c

### Coram Deo

The Coram Deo are a race of highly religious humans who share a pure matriarchal lineage back to the second diaspora.
They shun the use of genetic engineering or birthing pods and regularly practice eugenics to keep their bloodlines pure.
Their zealotry knows no bounds and they claim the original colonial ships as their temples. Any who approach them must
prove their bloodline or die.

Characteristics
* Average Height: 5'5"
* Average Weight: 150lb
* Preferred Gravity: 9.8 m/s^2
* Preferred Temperature: 24c

### Machines

#### Androsynth

The andosynth are a race of humanoid machines build by the embari during the first diaspera

#### Shoden

The Shoden are an offshoot race of self replicating sentient machines created by the androsynth during the diaspera to aid the in the
effort of colonization but somewhere along they way they gained sentience. They are a xenophobic race believing that
humans and their creations are a parasite on the universe.

#### Jasper

The Jasper are a mesh of man and machine. Born of a combination of Shoden nanotechnology and Emberi genetics they are
are true fusion of machine and man but are more than the sum of their parts.


### Uplifted

As humans reached for the stars they took their pets and native animals with them but also began experimenting with
integrating their own DNA into them. This in turn created the uplifted.

#### Rodinean

Uplifted Rats

#### Volken

Uplifted Wolves

#### Nekona

#### Rapten

Uplifted Birds/Lizards

#### Arachnae

Uplifted Arachnids

### Clairsentience
Clairsentience powers enable a character to learn secrets long forgotten, to glimpse the immediate future and predict 
the far future, to find hidden objects, and to know what is normally unknowable. They include precognition and remote 
viewing. A psion who specializes in clairsentience is known as a seer, and is most akin to an arcane diviner. In 3rd edition, Clairsentience is linked to Wisdom.

### Metacreativity
Metacreativity powers create objects, creatures, or some form of matter. Creatures a character creates usually, but not

psionic fabricate.
 
### Metapsionics
Metapsionic powers generally augment other psionic powers, although the discipline also contains some utility powers. 

### Psychokinesis
Psychokinesis powers manipulate energy or tap the power of the mind to produce a desired end. Many of these powers 
produce spectacular effects such as moving, melting, transforming, or blasting a target. Psychokinesis powers can deal 
large amounts of damage. They include energy missile and tornado blast. A psion who specializes in psychokinesis is 
known as a kineticist, and is most akin to an arcane evoker. In 3rd edition, Psychokinesis is linked to Constitution.
